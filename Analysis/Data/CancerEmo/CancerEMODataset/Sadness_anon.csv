"Hi BuzzzThere is one distinct difference between these 2 technologies, CyberKnife uses radiation which is gamma rays  to kill cancer cells, radiation contaminates any other surrounding cells that it comes into contact with.. HIFU is totally different because it does not use any radiation and only uses Ultra High Frequenscy laser which the Dr. uses to cook the cells effected which kills the bad cells, it's focused laser beam raises the temperature to 60 degrees celcius which kills the cells, there is no radiation.. don't get me wrong I think CK is a much better technology than the previous methods of radiation therapy which was beamed at the Prostate and other tissues which it also killed..  of course I am no expert but I know when I had my CT Scan everyone left the room because I was being <PERSON> which shows that radiation is dangerous to life...<PERSON>",0,0
