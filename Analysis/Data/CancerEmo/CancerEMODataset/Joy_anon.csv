Great news that the pathology report said T2C which means it did not escape and from what you wrote it appears that the .05 was how close the margin to becoming a positive reading but you are negative……but the scary thing is that your biopsy was a T1 and unless you get surgery you never know what you really have…like me I was a clinical T2B and my pathology said T3B…big difference…This is opne of the reasons I had surgery just to know what I was really dealing with...Please post the actual report highlights when you get them...In any event you have much to be thankful for…enjoy the day,1,0
