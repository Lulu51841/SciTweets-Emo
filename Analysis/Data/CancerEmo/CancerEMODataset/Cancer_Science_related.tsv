old and a nursing student.My aunt passed away of SCLC in September and my dad just passed away on January 13th of NSCLC.He was just diagnosed back in September so it was somewhat unexpected.Doctors had given him six months to a year.For some reason they hadn't done any new scans to see how the cancer was responding to treatment.He was supposed to have a scan on January 24th but didn't quite make it.It's been very hard on me since I was the only one caring for him and because of the things I saw.I was coping well at first but recently I've felt like I've been hit by a train.I stay anxious and cry and panic especially at night.I never really was close to my dad until his last three months.I think that's what makes it hurt so much worse.I dont know of any grief counselors in my area and I hate talking to friends and family about it.I feel like I'm weak when I do and after a while it's like friends get tired of hearing about it.Does anyone have any advice for coping or anyone in Mississippi that knows of support places preferably in the Northwest region?

Hi BuzzzThere is one distinct difference between these 2 technologies, CyberKnife uses radiation which is gamma rays  to kill cancer cells, radiation contaminates any other surrounding cells that it comes into contact with..

The reasons I chose CK over PBT were because: 1) PBT was not covered by my insurance -- CA Blue Cross/Blue Shield; however, CK was covered -- I have a written policy statement for CA BC/BS that says so and it should also be covered by other BC/BS providers on the same basis; 2) PBT takes 2 months of daily treatments at a limited # of sites in the US which requires moving to and living near an available treatment site for the entire time period -- CK only requires 4-5 treatments either consecutively over a week or every other day over 2 weeks; and 3) PBT does not as precisely target the prostate as CK does and has a greater potential for collateral tissue damage and side effects than CK does, although reports for the 2 forms of treatment are very similar.4) No need to fight for PBT insurance coverage if you decide to go w/CK and your BC/BS carrier is willing to cover it, which is should based on CA BC/BS's policy statement, which I can provide to you if you need it.So, my recommendation is for you to investigate the availability of CK as a form of treatment in lieu of PBT.
